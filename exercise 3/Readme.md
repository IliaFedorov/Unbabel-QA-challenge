To Execute 1st autotest you'd need:
Python (i've used 3.6+) 
Selenium2Library  
Chrome webDriver\firefox webdriver(default for Selenium)  

Kantu chrome widget
use file test2.html

or 

use \directory\ robot test.txt in cmd 

Button case (sign up) was the hardest to automate, occasionally it does not execute properly.
